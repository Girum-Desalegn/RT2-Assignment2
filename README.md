# Assignment2 - The two-wheelded mobile robot
=============================================
This assignment involves creating an action client node to allow the user to provide the (x, y) position of the robot using widgets. Additionally, FuncAnimation is used to plot the robotâ€™s position, the targets' positions in the environment, and the number of reached/not-reached targets.

This Jupyter notebook uses button widgets to allow the user to specify the position of the robot. After inserting the robot's position, the user can click send, resume, or cancel depending on their desired action.

Two graphs are provided in the notebook using the FuncAnimation function. The first graph displays the movement of the robot, showing its progress towards the target position in real-time. The second graph is a bar chart, which shows the number of reached and cancelled targets.
